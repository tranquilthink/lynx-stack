# GenUI Playground

## Runtime Boundaries

### Web and Native Host APIs

When sharing GenUI playground code between web preview and native Lynx execution paths, do not use bare `window` access in code that may run in Lynx. Read web-only capabilities through optional `globalThis` host adapters, and pass native preview data through `globalProps` or bridge fields rather than relying on browser globals.

When runtime code needs to distinguish Lynx for Web from native Lynx, prefer `SystemInfo.platform === 'web'` over `typeof window !== 'undefined'`. Native Lynx environments may expose browser-like globals, while Web Core explicitly sets `SystemInfo.platform` to `web`.

### Playback Synchronization

When wiring playback state between the Lynx app and the web preview, prefer `NativeModules.bridge.call('A2UI_PLAYBACK_SYNC', state, callback)` on the Lynx side and `lynxView.onNativeModulesCall` on the web preview side. Keep `window.postMessage` only as a compatibility fallback for older bundles. Do not add new playback sync paths that bypass the NativeModules bridge.

When automating A2UI preview benchmarks, wrap `render.html` in a parent iframe with a `previewMetricId`, listen for `A2UI_PREVIEW_METRIC` in the parent, and inject generated messages with `A2UI_LIVE_MESSAGES` after `A2UI_RENDER_READY`. Loading generated messages only through the initial query payload can capture FCP/FMP/TTI, but it does not exercise the Create page's live-delivery path that reports the repeatable Render metric.

Treat Bench reports as a protocol-neutral product area. Use `#/bench` as the canonical Runner route, keep `#/bench/runner` as a compatibility alias, and publish studies under phase routes such as `#/bench/phase-1`. This leaves later phases free to compare A2UI with other protocols. Keep legacy `#/a2ui/bench` hashes only as compatibility inputs. This route guidance does not apply to the A2UI server API paths under `/a2ui/bench/jobs`.

### Native Test Bundles

When serving the playground's native Lynx bundles as static Android test fixtures, keep HMR/React refresh out of `a2ui.lynx.js` and `openui.lynx.js`. The Android Lynx runtime does not provide globals such as `__prefresh_utils__` or Node's `process`, so normalize `process.env.NODE_ENV` at build time and disable HMR for these bundles instead of relying on the caller's `NODE_ENV`.

## Chat Page Architecture

Use the build-time `GENUI_SERVER_URL` environment variable as the single
default GenUI server origin for Chat, Bench, health checks, and preview payload
publishing. Keep its fallback at `http://localhost:3060`, validate it as a
credential-free HTTP(S) origin in the playground build configuration, and do
not reintroduce separate hosted-server constants in individual frontend
modules. URL query endpoint overrides may remain available for diagnosis.

Load Create-tab server-owned model choices from the GenUI server's `GET /models` endpoint. Also provide a custom-provider control with model and API key fields plus a fixed selector containing the server-approved OpenAI-compatible base URLs; do not accept an arbitrary custom-provider URL in the playground. Store each endpoint's default model in the same option mapping and replace the model field with that default whenever the endpoint changes. When the endpoint reports that `GENUI_MODEL_CONFIG_JSON` is absent, select that custom provider instead of blocking the Create tab. Persist only the non-sensitive provider selection in browser local storage. Keep model, API key, and base URL only in current-page memory so they survive protocol switches; after a refresh, clear the API key and restore the built-in model and base URL defaults. Never restore custom-provider fields left by older persisted formats so the next settings write removes them. Keep the API key input visually masked. Send custom provider values only in model request bodies, and continue sending only the public model name for ordinary server-owned selections.

Route all protocol Create tabs through `pages/chat/ChatPage.tsx`. Keep all shared React state, effects, conversation operations, provider controls, usage and preview metrics, streaming transport, examples, actions, and rendering in `pages/chat/ChatController.tsx`. Keep the shared conversation list, header, transcript/composer slots, resizable preview, delete confirmation, copy toast, and mobile tabs in `pages/chat/ChatWorkspace.tsx`, with styles in `pages/chat/ChatPage.css`.

Keep `pages/chat/a2ui.ts`, `pages/chat/openui.ts`, `pages/chat/mcp-apps.ts`, `pages/chat/lynx-xml.ts`, and `pages/chat/html.ts` as hook-free, JSX-free protocol adapters. They may define protocol request bodies, stream reducers, history conversion, persistence payloads, artifacts, examples, preview sources, and action conversion, but must not duplicate the controller's React state or host-side effects. Whole-document adapters should expose cumulative partial source as a live artifact while reserving reload-based preview delivery for a complete document.

For MCP Apps tool turns, show the model's tool selection and the host-executed tool result as separate JSON transcript entries. Build those entries through the same pure helper for live success and history hydration so reopened conversations preserve the Tool Call/Tool Result sequence.

Keep `lynx-src/mcp-apps` unaware of MCP Apps protocol details. Define renderer inputs and local APIs there, and perform MCP registry construction, `ui://` mapping, and the initial JSON-RPC tool selection in the chat adapter.

Import MCP Apps Lynx host components, renderer definitions, and registries through `@lynx-js/genui/mcp-apps/render`. Keep shared data contracts on the compatibility root entry and MCP protocol metadata and JSON-RPC types on the separate `@lynx-js/genui/mcp-apps/protocol` entry.

Keep MCP Apps card interactions local to the renderer. Refresh, purchase, and similar card actions must call the card's sibling `api.ts` directly and update renderer-owned state; do not relay them through `NativeModules`, `window.postMessage`, a Chat action adapter, or the agent. Register only model-visible tools needed to create the initial card.

Use `mcpAppData` as the MCP Apps-specific preview payload field across Chat preview sources, render URLs, render-page init data, and Lynx `globalProps`. Do not expose this protocol-specific payload through a generic `appData` field.

Keep OpenUI artifacts visually aligned with A2UI Generated Output cards: use the same transcript width, compact header alignment, single divider, and code-block density while preserving OpenUI-specific Raw/Parsed views and metadata.

When rendering the unified `ChatPage`, key it by protocol so switching between A2UI, OpenUI, MCP Apps, Lynx XML, and HTML fully remounts the controller. This prevents in-flight requests, import guards, provider state, transcript state, and preview refs from leaking across protocols.

## Protocol-Aware Conversation Data

### Local History

When adding or updating playground conversation history, keep records isolated by protocol. Store new records with `ConversationMeta.protocol`, use protocol-scoped active-id metadata such as `activeConversationId:a2ui` and `activeConversationId:openui`, and treat legacy records without a `protocol` field as A2UI conversations so existing browser history remains visible.

Rebuild A2UI `Generated Output` cards from each ordinary assistant history entry, preserving transcript order and rendering the entry's A2UI message array as separate chunks. Keep successful action responses in their action-specific Applied cards, and do not replace history-scoped output cards with a single controller-level artifact derived from the latest preview output.

When an action response is merged with the current preview messages, clear any previous or action-only snapshot payload URL and persist the merged inline preview. Treat an explicitly present `snapshotPreviewPayloadUrls: null` as a clear operation rather than falling back to `previewPayloadUrls`; otherwise reopened and shared conversations can render a stale pre-action snapshot.

### Shared Imports

Publish playground payloads through the GenUI server's PUT endpoints and use the returned public URL as an opaque value; do not hardcode storage-provider hosts or object paths in frontend code. Publish a shared conversation with storage type `conversation` and its validated protocol (`a2ui`, `openui`, `mcp-apps`, `lynx-xml`, or `html`) as the storage method; treat a missing protocol as legacy A2UI and reject an unknown protocol before uploading. When importing shared playground conversations, accept same-origin HTTP(S) documents or credential-free cross-origin HTTPS documents, fetch them with credentials omitted, then validate the shared document schema and protocol before calling `importShared`. Treat a missing shared-document protocol as legacy A2UI, and reject unknown or mismatched protocols.

## Component Catalog Architecture

### Shared Page and Protocol Sources

Keep page structure and editor/example selection state in `pages/catalog/ComponentCatalog.tsx`, with its styles co-located in `pages/catalog/ComponentCatalog.css`. Route both protocols through `pages/catalog/ComponentsPage.tsx`, and keep protocol-specific catalog data, validation, and render URL construction in `pages/catalog/a2ui.ts` and `pages/catalog/openui.ts`.

Use `catalog` as the canonical tab id and URL segment for both A2UI and OpenUI component catalogs. Continue parsing legacy `components` URLs as a compatibility alias, but generate all new navigation and component-detail links with `catalog`.

Keep the shared editor, copy feedback, example tabs, and `PreviewViewport` layout in `pages/catalog/ComponentUsagePreview.tsx`.

### Shared Presentation

Keep the A2UI and OpenUI component catalog pages visually identical by rendering both through `ComponentCatalog` and selecting a protocol-specific catalog source. Protocol-specific sources may vary their copy, routes, catalog data, validation, and preview payload construction, but must not duplicate the shared page JSX or add protocol-specific page-shell or component-card styling overrides.

### Catalog Preview Payloads

Send editable OpenUI usage DSL through `buildOpenUIRenderUrl` with `instant: true`, and forward the playground theme so the Lynx preview matches the surrounding catalog page.

Component catalog examples are intentionally inline-only. Keep every bundled usage snippet below `OPENUI_INLINE_RENDER_URL_MAX_LENGTH`, reject oversized edits with a visible error, and reserve `rawTextUrl` publishing for larger Examples/Create payloads rather than publishing on each catalog-editor keystroke.

## Example Showcase Architecture

Keep the shared example-list page structure, preview queue, keyboard interaction, section rendering, and card layout in `pages/demos/DemosList.tsx`. Route A2UI, OpenUI, and MCP Apps through `pages/demos/DemosListPage.tsx`, and keep protocol-specific scenarios, sections, preview URL construction, and queue reset keys in `pages/demos/a2ui.ts`, `pages/demos/openui.ts`, and `pages/demos/mcp-apps.ts`.

Protocol-specific showcase sources may vary their header copy, section links, badges, layout mode, and preview payload construction, but must not duplicate the shared list-page JSX or card interaction logic.

Keep the shared example-detail workspace, editor/preview resizing, playback state machine, progress bridge, scenario sidebar, and mobile tabs in `pages/demos/DemosPage.tsx`, with its styles in `pages/demos/DemosPage.css`. Keep protocol-specific editor configuration, commit validation, playback chunking, payload publishing, and `PreviewPanelSource` construction in the respective `pages/demos/a2ui.ts`, `pages/demos/openui.ts`, and `pages/demos/mcp-apps.ts` source modules.

Keep MCP Apps Examples aligned with the renderer registry in `lynx-src/mcp-apps/App.tsx`. Build their deterministic preview data through each renderer's sibling `api.ts`, validate edited data with the shared host parser plus the renderer-specific result parser, and render list and detail previews through the existing `mcp-apps.web.js` / `mcp-apps.lynx.js` bundles.

### Lynx XML

- Expose Lynx XML Create at its protocol root and Examples at `/examples`; keep Catalog and Bench unavailable. Route Create through the shared Chat controller and the dedicated Lynx XML adapter.
- Stream cumulative canonical source into the Create artifact viewer as soon as `<!doctype lynx>` arrives. Do not reload `<lynx-view>` for incomplete source; hand the complete document to the direct Lynx XML preview only after the final stream event.
- Reuse the A2UI Playground Examples `flow` layout, `DemosList`, `ExamplePreviewCard`, and card styles without protocol-specific markup or CSS.
- Keep complete `.lynxml` artifacts in `src/mock/lynx-xml`, import them as raw editor source, copy them to `dist/demos/lynx-xml`, and load them directly in `<lynx-view>`. Mount generated and edited XML through `PreviewViewport`'s direct `LynxXmlView`; use an `application/xml` Blob URL only to satisfy LynxView's public URL input, and never turn XML into A2UI/OpenUI init data, global props, or events. Use the shared `render.html?protocol=lynx-xml&sourceUrl=...` entry for shareable/example Web URLs and keep its XML protocol branch direct instead of invoking a bundled protocol renderer. Do not add per-example compilation or a ReactLynx renderer. Browser-local Blob URLs are not shareable: keep the Web and Native QR cards mounted with an unavailable placeholder instead of encoding the Blob URL or removing the QR pane. Use `@codemirror/lang-html` in the editor and keep Playback disabled.
- Append the business root directly to the Element PAPI `page`; do not style the page or add a generic `app` wrapper. The root owns viewport, background, and layout styles, and must be a vertical scroll view when content may overflow. Because Lynx defaults to Linear layout, every layout container must explicitly use `display: flex` and declare its intended `flex-direction`.

### HTML

- Expose HTML only at its Create protocol root; keep Examples, Catalog, Bench, and native preview unavailable.
- Stream cumulative source into the shared artifact viewer as soon as the HTML doctype arrives, but do not execute partial markup or scripts. Deliver only a complete document to the reload-based preview.
- Render HTML through `HtmlView` as iframe `srcDoc` with exactly the script capability required for generated interactions. Keep `allow-same-origin` out of the sandbox so model-authored code cannot read the Playground DOM, cookies, or local storage. Do not send HTML through `render.html`, `<lynx-view>`, init data, global props, native URLs, or Lynx bundles.

## OpenUI Integration

### Lynx Entry Styling

When maintaining the OpenUI Lynx entry under `packages/genui/playground/lynx-src/openui`, import only the host-level style inputs that the entry owns: `@lynx-js/luna-styles/index.css` first, then `@lynx-js/genui/openui/styles/theme.css`. Do not import OpenUI catalog CSS, renderer CSS, `styles/material-icons.css`, `styles/index.css`, or `styles/renderer.css` from the playground entry.

OpenUI catalog styles are bundled by each catalog component's relative CSS import, the renderer style is bundled by `renderer.tsx` importing `./renderer.css`, and Material Icons font CSS is bundled by the Icon component. If the native preview looks unstyled, fix the source-side CSS import in `packages/genui/openui` instead of adding a package-level aggregate stylesheet to the playground entry.

OpenUI playground theming should apply matching classes such as `openui-light luna-light` or `openui-dark luna-dark` on the Lynx root view. Keep theme-specific feedback, loading, and scroll styling in the entry CSS instead of inline styles so Luna variables can control both the shell and renderer content.

Gate host-specific OpenUI visual treatments behind an additional root class in the playground entry CSS instead of changing the shared OpenUI theme tokens. For transparent editorial previews, keep the root, page, and scroll backgrounds transparent; scope Card surface removal and enlarged typography/spacing to that host class so the package defaults and Modal/control boundaries remain intact. Keep the render document's `data-theme` and `color-scheme` synchronized with preview init data so transparent Lynx content inherits the correct neutral light or dark device canvas instead of the iframe's default white background.

### Large Preview Payloads

For local A2UI Web previews without `demoId` or `messagesUrl`, serialize the messages into an `application/json` Blob and pass its object URL through `messagesUrl` so local and remote JSON use the same runtime loading path. Reuse that object URL while the messages are unchanged; after replacement, keep it alive until the consuming runtime reports that loading completed, with a bounded cleanup fallback, and revoke all remaining URLs on unmount. Deliver later live deltas through `A2UI_LIVE_MESSAGES`, and replay the current surface only after the Lynx A2UI runtime reports that its message store is ready; the outer render-frame listener alone is not sufficient readiness. Give every `PreviewViewport` render navigation a unique token, require runtime-ready messages to echo it, and bind readiness fallbacks to the loaded URL and window so a delayed signal from an older iframe document cannot unlock the current frame. Blob URLs are local-only: share and native URLs must never expose them, and live share/native URLs require `demoId` or a published HTTP(S) `messagesUrl`. Apply `A2UI_INLINE_RENDER_URL_MAX_LENGTH` to remaining non-live inline A2UI preview URLs so deployed request-line limits cannot produce HTTP 414 responses.

When building OpenUI playground preview links, avoid inlining large OpenUI Lang source in `rawText` query parameters. URL-encoded Chinese or generated DSL can exceed common request-line limits on deployed hosts; publish large source text and pass `rawTextUrl` to `render.html` instead.

## LazyComponent Integration

### Bundle Build

When adding a GenUI playground example that uses a ReactLynx standalone lazy bundle, build that lazy bundle with a separate Rspeedy config using `pluginReactLynx({ experimental_isLazyBundle: true })`.

Keep `output.cleanDistPath: false`, and run the lazy bundle build after the main `rspeedy build` so the main preview bundle does not clean the lazy bundle assets.

Keep both `web` and `lynx` environments enabled when the same lazy demo should run in browser and mobile previews. The lazy bundle output names should stay paired, for example `a2ui-lazy-component.web.bundle` for Lynx for Web and `a2ui-lazy-component.lynx.bundle` for native Lynx.

### URL and Payload Ownership

LazyComponent demo data should contain complete `url` and `webUrl` values before it reaches preview rendering. Build those URLs at data construction time from the runtime playground base URL, with query and hash removed and file paths such as `render.html` collapsed to their containing directory. Keep this resolution in the demo data layer, not in `PreviewPanel`.

Only demos backed by files copied to `dist/demos/*.json` should use `demoId` short links. Runtime-built demos such as `lazy-component` and `mcp-app` should remain known playground scenarios, but because no corresponding `dist/demos/*.json` file exists, their local Web preview should expose the messages through a Blob `messagesUrl` while non-live native QR preview links may continue to carry inline `messages`.

Keep `PreviewPanel` unaware of LazyComponent payload structure. It should select `demoId`, a portable `messagesUrl`, or local `messages/actionMocks`; derive a Blob `messagesUrl` only for the local Web preview, while keeping share and QR/native payloads portable.

For the A2UI `LazyComponent` catalog component, load ReactLynx standalone lazy bundle URLs with `import(url, { with: { type: 'component' } })`. In web rendering, use `webUrl` only when `SystemInfo.platform === 'web'`; if `webUrl` is absent, show the mobile-scan fallback instead of trying to load the native `url` in Lynx for Web.
