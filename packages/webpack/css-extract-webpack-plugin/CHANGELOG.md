# @lynx-js/css-extract-webpack-plugin

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Emit the intermediate files into `.lynx` instead of `.rspeedy`, since the directory is written by the Lynx build engine rather than by Rspeedy. The directory is no longer configurable: `output.distPath.intermediate` was documented as never read, and nothing else reads it now either. ([#3682](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3682))

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- Allow the next minor of `@lynx-js/template-webpack-plugin` as a peer dependency. ([#3362](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3362))

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Rename the lazy bundle output directory from `async/` to `lazy-bundle/`. ([#2993](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2993))

  Lazy bundles can now also be loaded synchronously with `import(..., { with: { mode: 'sync' } })`, so the `async/` directory name no longer matches how they are used. The default `lazyBundleFilename` becomes `lazy-bundle/[name].[fullhash].bundle`, and the intermediate outputs move from `.rspeedy/async/<name>/` to `.rspeedy/lazy-bundle/<name>/` accordingly.

  Update deployment scripts that reference the `dist/async/` directory to use `dist/lazy-bundle/` instead.

  `@lynx-js/css-extract-webpack-plugin` requires `@lynx-js/template-webpack-plugin` `^0.14.0`.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Stop injecting `webpackChunkName` into dynamic imports so lazy bundle intermediate files stay inside the output directory. ([#2961](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2961))

  The ReactLynx transform injected `webpackChunkName: "<request>-react__<layer>"`, so a dynamic import resolving above the compiler context (e.g. `import('../../Foo.js')`) leaked `../` into `[name]`/`[id]` and the intermediate js/css/hmr files escaped the output directory. Async chunks now keep rspack's own ids, `__webpack_require__.lynx_aci` maps them by chunk id, and each lazy bundle's intermediate JS and CSS are emitted under `.rspeedy/async/<bundle-name>/<layer>.js` and `<layer>.css` next to its other intermediate outputs (`tasm.json`, `debug-metadata.json`, CSS hot-update files). Explicit `webpackChunkName` comments written by users are still honored and keep the user-controlled `[name]` placement. Main-thread chunks no longer emit CSS hot-update files — CSS only exists on the background thread, and the main-thread HMR runtime receives updates from it.

  These packages release together and must be upgraded together: `@lynx-js/react-webpack-plugin` and `@lynx-js/css-extract-webpack-plugin` require `@lynx-js/template-webpack-plugin` `^0.13.0`, and `@lynx-js/react-rsbuild-plugin` requires `@lynx-js/react` `^0.123.0`.

### Patch Changes

- Widen the `@lynx-js/template-webpack-plugin` peer range to `^0.13.0` to accept the ([#2584](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2584))
  minor that ships the FetchBundle chunk encoding.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE** ([#2803](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2803))

  Remove `CssExtractWebpackPlugin` / `CssExtractWebpackPluginOptions` along with the `mini-css-extract-plugin` dependency. Use `CssExtractRspackPlugin` instead.

  The `cssPlugins` option is now optional, defaulting to `[CSS.Plugins.removeFunctionWhiteSpace()]`.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** ([#2803](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2803))

  Drop webpack support — the plugins now target Rspack only. All public types come from `@rspack/core` instead of `webpack` (e.g. `Compiler`, `Compilation`, `LoaderContext`), and the `webpack` dependency is removed.

### Patch Changes

- Prefix Lynx runtime module names with `webpack/runtime/` (e.g. `Lynx async chunks` → `webpack/runtime/lynx async chunks`), matching the path-structured naming of the bundler's built-in runtime modules. The previous bare names had no path segment, so when they appear as a source-map `sources` entry under a `file://` module-filename template they collapsed into an invalid URL authority (the space-containing name became the host) and broke `SourceMapConsumer` parsing. ([#2642](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2642))

- Widen peer ranges to admit the new minor versions of `@lynx-js/template-webpack-plugin` (^0.12.0) and `@lynx-js/rspeedy` (^0.15.0) shipping with the unified `debug-metadata.json` feature. ([#2642](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/2642))
