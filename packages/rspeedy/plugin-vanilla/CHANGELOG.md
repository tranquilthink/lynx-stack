# `@lynx-js/vanilla-rsbuild-plugin`

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- **BREAKING CHANGE**: Require `@lynx-js/rspeedy` `^0.17.0` in the plugins that read the build engine config through `Symbol.for('@lynx-js/rsbuild-plugin:config')`, since the engine that ships with `0.16` does not expose it. The plugins that do not touch the engine keep their existing range and add `^0.17.0` to it. ([#3682](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3682))

### Patch Changes

- Declare the build host as an optional peer dependency. `@rsbuild/core` covers a plain Rsbuild build, and `@lynx-js/rspeedy` covers an Rspeedy one, so whichever host is installed is version-checked. ([#3678](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3678))

- Honor `output.distPath.intermediate`. The Lynx build engine now resolves the intermediate directory, so the option is no longer ignored by the plugins that emit a Lynx bundle. ([#3676](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3676))

- Resolve the bundle filename through `getLynxConfig(api).resolveBundleFilename()` instead of reading `output.filename` out of the Rspeedy config. A configured filename is now honored when the plugins are used with Rsbuild directly. ([#3651](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3651))

- Expose `Symbol.for('LynxTemplatePlugin')` from `pluginLynx` instead of from each DSL plugin, so the plugins that tap the template hooks work with the build engine alone. ([#3675](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3675))

- Wrap the background chunk again. The runtime wrapper only matched assets under `.rspeedy/`, so once the intermediate directory moved to `.lynx/` the background chunk shipped without the wrapper and failed on load with `ReferenceError: lynx is not defined`. The wrapper now targets the background asset the plugin emits, wherever the intermediate directory lives. ([#3745](https://github.com/lynx-family/lynx-stack/pull/3745))
